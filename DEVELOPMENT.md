# Development Setup Summary

## ‚úÖ Concurrently Configuration Complete

The project is now set up with `concurrently` to run both the real-time server and client application simultaneously.

### What's Configured

1. **Root package.json** with concurrently scripts
2. **VS Code tasks** for easy development
3. **Startup scripts** for Windows and Unix systems
4. **Color-coded output** for easy debugging

### Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Install all dependencies
npm run install:all

# Start everything in development mode
npm run dev
```

### Concurrently Features

- **Color-coded output**: Server logs in blue, client logs in magenta
- **Process naming**: Clear [SERVER] and [CLIENT] prefixes
- **Kill on fail**: If one process fails, both stop
- **Auto-restart**: Using nodemon for server, Next.js hot reload for client

### Available Scripts

| Command               | Description                                |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `npm run dev`         | Start both server and client (development) |
| `npm run start`       | Start both server and client (production)  |
| `npm run server`      | Start only the server (development)        |
| `npm run client`      | Start only the client (development)        |
| `npm run install:all` | Install dependencies for all packages      |
| `npm run clean`       | Remove all node_modules                    |

### VS Code Integration

- **Default build task**: "Start Everything (Concurrently)"
- **Keyboard shortcut**: `Ctrl+Shift+P` ‚Üí "Tasks: Run Build Task"
- **Multiple options**: Individual services or combined

### Platform Support

- **Windows**: `start.bat` script
- **Unix/Linux/macOS**: `start.sh` script
- **Cross-platform**: npm scripts work everywhere

## Development Workflow

1. **First time setup**:

   ```bash
   npm run install:all
   ```

2. **Daily development**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Individual services** (if needed):

   ```bash
   # Terminal 1
   npm run server

   # Terminal 2
   npm run client
   ```

## Output Example

When running `npm run dev`, you'll see:

```
[SERVER] üöÄ Real-time server running on port 5001
[SERVER] ‚úÖ Connected to MongoDB
[CLIENT] ‚ñ≤ Next.js 14.2.5
[CLIENT] - Local:        http://localhost:3000
[SERVER] üåê Accepting connections from http://localhost:3000
[CLIENT] ‚úì Ready in 2.1s
```

## Benefits

- **Single command startup** - No need to manage multiple terminals
- **Consistent logging** - Color-coded and labeled output
- **Error handling** - Both processes stop if one fails
- **IDE integration** - Works seamlessly with VS Code
- **Cross-platform** - Scripts work on Windows, macOS, and Linux

The collaborative editor is now ready for efficient development! üöÄ

## ü§ù **How to Collaborate (NEW!)**

### **Updated User Interface**

The application now has a proper collaboration system:

1. **Document Dashboard** (http://localhost:3000)

   - Create new documents
   - View existing documents
   - Copy share links for collaboration

2. **Document Editor** (http://localhost:3000/editor/[documentId])
   - Real-time collaborative editing
   - Share button to invite others
   - Live connection status

### **How Users Join a Session**

**Method 1: Create & Share**

1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Create a new document with a title
3. Click "Copy Share Link"
4. Send the link to collaborators
5. Others click the link to join the same document

**Method 2: Join Existing Document**

1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. See list of recent documents
3. Click "Join Session" on any document
4. Start collaborating immediately

**Method 3: Direct URL**

- Share direct links like: `http://localhost:3000/editor/[documentId]`
- Anyone with the link can join and edit

### **Real-time Features**

- ‚úÖ **Live typing** - See changes as others type
- ‚úÖ **Auto-save** - Documents saved to MongoDB automatically
- ‚úÖ **Connection status** - Shows if you're connected to others
- ‚úÖ **Participant tracking** - Server tracks who's editing
- ‚úÖ **Share links** - Easy collaboration invitation

### **Testing Collaboration**

1. Start the app: `npm run dev`
2. Open http://localhost:3000 in two browser windows
3. Create a document in one window
4. Copy the share link and open it in the second window
5. Type in either window and watch real-time sync! üéâ
